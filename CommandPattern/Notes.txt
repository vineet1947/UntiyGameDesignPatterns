Command Pattern ==> 

This package contains 3 Scripts : 

1. InputHandler ==> It Conatins Key Mapping for key pressed and command ( or animaton) to be played  
2. Command => Have command thhat can be executed
3. CameraFollow360 ==> follows player automatically  


The abstract class Execute is used execute any animation of choice
focues on the operations we can perfom by using this kind of Program Pattern 

specifically using this I was able to cache my command steps that we executed and created a replay system for the 
example project that is bascially a charcter movement and actions the it can use
