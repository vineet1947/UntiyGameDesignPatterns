1 .This project aims to understand the memory usuage 
   for the meshes created ! 

2. MoreOver this patterns is internally build into unity 

3. A Better Use case is by using "com.unity.entity" and "com.unity.entities.graphics" 

as Using the DOTS patterns is really useful for flyweight patterns but programming then 
can be a tough task  !! 



** The Cube in this project is used for making terrians using perline noise ==>  

using 1000 * 1000 dim plane will crash your program and using the dots entities patterns will 
help to get through this
